# Swagger Framework & Unity Dependency Injection Framework Sample Usage in ASP.Net Web Api
Swagger framework is added to test this project, if you manage to run it in VS, you can go to (http://localhost:27417/swagger) to see what are the api availables and test the api directly via swagger.

What the project does is just a simple Task Tracking Service with in-memory storage to showcase how Swagger is created by the controller action name instead of controller http method and Unity DI is used to make the project more testable.
